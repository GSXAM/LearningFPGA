## NAND gate
- NAND gate for simulation testing.

## Hex to 7 segments LED
- Implementation common anode or common cathode
- Implementation in either logical operator or condition operator
## Encoder 8 to 3
- Implementation encoder 8 to 3 by condition operator, or logical operator or gate-level primitive
## Decoder 4 to 16 one-hot
- Implementation Decoder 4 to 16 one-hot by condition operator, or logical operator or gate-level primitive
## HDMI transmitter
- Implementation TMDS encoder refer to TMDS encode algorithm in DVI specification V1.0
- Create some synchonous signals and data in HDMI top module
- Using DDR output buffer and run on Tang nano 4k FPGA board
## Clock divider
- Clock divider 16-bit for both odd and even
